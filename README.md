You probably don't.

For me, it sort of functions as a simplistic, skeleton reproduction of the actual project I am working on in `$DAYJOB`, which allows me to test some lower level changes before they go into company code.

All data and real structure stripped, of course, but I don't need them for this purpose right now.
