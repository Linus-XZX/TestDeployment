# Why do I need this?

You probably don't.

For me, it sort of functions as a simplistic, skeleton reproduction of the actual project I am working on in `$DAYJOB`, which allows me to test some lower level changes before they go into company code. And by committing them here I get to, ummm, track changes and document stuff ig...

All data and real structure stripped, of course, but I don't need them for this purpose right now.

# But... security issues!

Not really much I can do here since I am specifically replicating the company environment, outside of minor version updates. I might try to put in major updates as well when I am confident enough that they don't break things.

# TODOs

- Keep throwing updates in...? Not that I can really break this thing.
